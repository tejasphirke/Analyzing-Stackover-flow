## Introduction to data science

## Project: Amsterdam airbnb listings Analysis 

### Installations:
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

* scikit-learn==0.21.2

* pandas==0.24.2

* numpy==1.16.4

* matplotlib==3.1.0

* seaborn==0.9.0

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [ipython notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Project Motivation
As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project Term 2 project to write a Data science blogpost using CRISP-DM. I was intriguted to analyze and find business related questions about airbnb listings for Amsterdam city. This interest stem from being a frequent user of airbnb and a curious traveler that is interested in knowning the trends in prices and what can affect.

This can can be modified to analyze other data sets other than amsterdam data.

### Summary of the project
In this notebook I wanted to analyze the Amsterdam airbnb listings. I used descriptive statistics and Kmean clustering to answer the following questions:

Is it more expansive to book a listing during the high seasons?

I compared the price of a listing to the availability of listing to produce the supply demand curve which shows the inverse relation between the availability of listings and the average listings price.

2)Most expansive month to visit Amsterdam?

The peak in prices occur in the period between May and June and the cheapest period is between april and feb.

Most expansive and least expansive Neighbourhood in Amsterdam?
The Most Expansive neighbourhood is Centrum-Oost followed by Centrum-West which is reasonable since it is the city center of amsterdam city while the cheapest listings are in Bijlmer-Centrum and Bijlmer-Oost which is part of Amsterdam-Southeast part.

The prices in the center is around double the prices in the southeast and westernmost neighbourhoods of Amsterdam.

What are the attributes associated with the price of a listing?

Property type

Neighbourhood

Reviews in terms of review count and the recency of the reviews

Room Type
